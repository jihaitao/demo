Subclass of UITextView with syntax highlighting for iOS 5.0 not finished (just sample)

With new iOS 6.0 everyone junior developer can do code editor application with syntax highlighting. Because *UITextView* has attribute *attributedText*, which has enough parameters and functionality for it.

So, I want to say, my old project does not have sense. :)

The last build shared on git hub and everyone can modify it and try to finish, because it still not completed. Still has a problem with word wrap.

Maybe someone will get something new for self. Because this project used CoreText and CoreGraphics framework.

Enjoy!
